# wow-api

The idea behind this API is to provide the cheapest (and most profitable) recipes for any profession in World of Warcraft.

There are still some missing pieces because a new expansion released with a totally new profession system and I haven't got around to adding the items and fix the calculations for the new system and a few other things just yet and at this point I might as well just wait for the next expansion anyway.
